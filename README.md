# 🩸 Blood Donor Finder  
### AI Powered Blood Donor Finder System

An AI-powered web application designed to help hospitals find blood efficiently by first checking nearby blood banks and, if blood is unavailable, raising emergency requests to donors.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Blood Donor Finder** system connects **Hospitals, Blood Banks, Donors, and Admin** on a single platform to manage blood availability and emergency requests in real time.

The project follows a realistic healthcare workflow:

1. Hospitals first check **nearby blood banks**
2. If blood is unavailable, an **emergency blood request** is created
3. Donors are notified only during emergencies
4. Admin monitors all activities centrally
